This Online Library Management System is a full-stack web application developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python (Flask), and MySQL, designed to streamline book borrowing and management for users and administrators. It features user registration, login, book browsing by categories, cart-based book borrowing with date selection, and a transaction system that includes fine calculation for late returns. Administrators have access to a dedicated dashboard where they can manage users, approve borrow requests, monitor issued and returned books, and maintain the book database. The backend is powered by Flask for routing and logic, while MySQL handles data storage for users, books, and transactions. Screenshots included in the repository provide a visual overview of key pages such as the home page, book listing, borrow form, admin dashboard, and transaction summary.
